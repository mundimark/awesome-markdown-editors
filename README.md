## Markdown Desktop Editors

### Universal

**Atom** (FREE, open source)

Markdown Preview - to be done

**Visual Studio Code** (FREE)

to be done

**Typora** ($$, Free in beta)

Typora is a highly unique and powerful markdown editor. The most surprising and difficult to explain feature, is the **in place** live preview. In a nutshell as you type markdown it previews the text behind your cursor eliminating the need for a separate preview space.

In addition to including some very nice looking css based themes it also leverages the power of `pandoc` by using an intermediary format behind the scene allowing you to import and export to many popular document formats including.

The current version, 0.9.23-1, still has some minor bugs and the OS X version is still in beta but, wow, does it look great!

[**Abricotine**](https://github.com/brrd/Abricotine) (FREE, open source)

Abricotine supports very good instant preview like Typora, but is open source - free forever.

[**MarkText**](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) (FREE, open source)

MarkText is very similar to Abricotine, but it's development is much faster than Abricotine's (while isn't really stable yet).

[**Caret**](https://caret.io/) ($29 for continued use)

Features live preview, files sidebar, go to anything, advanced spell checker and a lot more.

[**Zettlr**](https://www.zettlr.com/) (FREE, open source)

Zettlr ships with a lot of features helpful in writing markdown. It is especially aimed at writing research papers in the arts and humanities (and therefore offers writing aids such as automatic footnote insertion and in-place editing, or a global search). Nonetheless it also supports LaTeX and code highlighting, which makes it interesting for developers as well. It features a file tree, plenty of exporting options and even supports whole projects (exporting multiple markdown files at once), live preview directly in the editor, and some Zettelkasten functionalities that enables the linking of files. Tags can also be used to sort your work.

[The code resides on GitHub](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr).
