**Typora** ($$, Free in beta)

Typora is a highly unique and powerful markdown editor. The most surprising and difficult to explain feature, is the **in place** live preview. In a nutshell as you type markdown it previews the text behind your cursor eliminating the need for a separate preview space.

In addition to including some very nice looking css based themes it also leverages the power of `pandoc` by using an intermediary format behind the scene allowing you to import and export to many popular document formats including.

The current version, 0.9.23-1, still has some minor bugs and the OS X version is still in beta but, wow, does it look great!

Features live preview, files sidebar, go to anything, advanced spell checker and a lot more.
